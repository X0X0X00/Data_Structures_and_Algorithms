# CSC172 Data Structures and Algorithms 
This course is a hands on introduction to Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms
using the Java programming language. You will learn to design, write and analyse
computer programs computers to determine eï¬ƒciency in terms of time and memory
utilization. Topics covered include:

Algorithmic thinking and computational problem solving

Searching and Sorting

Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashes, Maps

Backtracking, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Randomized Alorithms

Asymptotic (Big-O) Analysis, Proof by Induction, Recurrence Relations
